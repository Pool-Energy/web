                            Currently we charge 0.75% fee. That fee is subtracted from each farmer's reward.
                            For example, if in a given round the farmer is due a share of 0.05 XCH, then 0.75% of that (0.000375 XCH) will be kept as a pool fee and the rest (0.049625 XCH) will be credited to the farmer.
